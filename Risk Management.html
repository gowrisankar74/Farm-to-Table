    <h1>Risk Management Plan - Traceability Solution</h1>
    <h2>Identification of Risks and Hazards</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Data breaches and cyberattacks that compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the data collected and stored by the traceability solution.</li>
      <li>System failures, such as hardware or software malfunctions, that disrupt the data capture, storage, or retrieval process.</li>
      <li>Regulatory non-compliance that may result in fines, penalties, or legal liabilities for the stakeholders involved in the supply chain.</li>
      <li>Environmental hazards, such as natural disasters or accidents, that may affect the safety and quality of the products being tracked by the traceability solution.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Mitigation Strategies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Data encryption, access control, and monitoring to protect against data breaches and cyberattacks.</li>
      <li>Redundant hardware and software components, backup and recovery procedures, and disaster recovery plans to ensure system resilience and continuity.</li>
      <li>Compliance monitoring and reporting, regular audits and assessments, and staff training and awareness programs to ensure regulatory compliance and minimize legal risks.</li>
      <li>Environmental monitoring and reporting, emergency response plans, and supply chain diversification to mitigate the impact of environmental hazards on the supply chain.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Contingency Plans</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If a data breach or cyberattack occurs, the incident response team will be activated immediately to isolate and contain the affected systems, investigate the incident, and notify the relevant stakeholders.</li>
      <li>If a system failure occurs, the backup and recovery procedures will be activated to restore the system to normal operations as soon as possible.</li>
      <li>If a regulatory violation occurs, the compliance team will investigate the cause, implement corrective actions, and report the incident to the relevant authorities.</li>
      <li>If an environmental hazard occurs, the emergency response team will activate the emergency response plan, coordinate with the relevant authorities and stakeholders, and implement the necessary measures to ensure product safety and quality.</li>
    </ul>
