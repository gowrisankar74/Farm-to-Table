    <h1>Technology Implementation Plan - Traceability Solution</h1>
    <h2>Hardware Components</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>RFID readers</li>
      <li>Barcode scanners</li>
      <li>GPS devices</li>
      <li>IoT sensors</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Software Components</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Blockchain platform</li>
      <li>Data management system</li>
      <li>Data analytics tools</li>
      <li>Mobile applications</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Deployment Strategy</h2>
    <p>The traceability solution will be deployed in three phases:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Pilot phase: A small-scale test of the system with a single product line and a limited number of participants.</li>
      <li>Rollout phase: A gradual expansion of the system to additional product lines and participants, with a focus on training and support.</li>
      <li>Scaling phase: A full-scale deployment of the system across all product lines and participants, with ongoing monitoring and optimization.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Testing and Validation Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Unit testing: Testing of individual hardware and software components to ensure they meet the specifications and requirements.</li>
      <li>Integration testing: Testing of the integrated system to ensure it functions as a whole and meets the business needs.</li>
      <li>User acceptance testing: Testing by end-users to ensure the system meets their expectations and usability requirements.</li>
      <li>Performance testing: Testing to evaluate the system's speed, reliability, and scalability under various conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Timeline</h2>
    <p>The timeline for the implementation of the traceability solution is as follows:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Phase</th>
        <th>Start Date</th>
        <th>End Date</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        
        <td>Pilot</td>
        <td>January 2023</td>
        <td>March 2023</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

        <td>Rollout</td>
        <td>April 2023</td>
        <td>December 2023</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

        <td>Scaling</td>
        <td>January 2024</td>
        <td>December 2024</td>
      </tr>
